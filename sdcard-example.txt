*** Example procedure to test mmc or sdcard filling it with random and check md5sum ***

# !!! WARN: this procedure will ERASE COMPLETELY the sd/mmc card !!!
# !!! if you make mistakes in selecting the right device (mmcblk0 in the example below)
# !!! you can erase the wrong device !!! You've been warned, take care !!!

# run commands as root

lsblk
# we identified that sdcard is at mmcblk0 with 64GB

# getting the size in bytes
blockdev --getsize64 /dev/mmcblk0
63864569856

# convert to blocks
63864569856 / 512 = 124735488 blocks

# filling the entire sdcard with random data
dd if=/dev/urandom bs=512 count=124735488 | CHUNKSIZE=0 md5tee /tmp/md5-write.txt | dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 status=progress

# sync output buffers, this may take a minute
sync

# drop RAM caches, to prevent some data to be read from caches
echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

# read entire sdcard
dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 count=124735488 status=progress | md5sum - > /tmp/md5-read.txt

# compare the contents of /tmp/md5-write.txt and /tmp/md5-read.txt
# if md5 matches, then the write->read procedure was successful
